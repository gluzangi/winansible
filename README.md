# Ansible-On-Windows README.md

__winAnsible__ is an attempt to create a Windows MSI package to an experimental Ansible implementation on Windows. In the meantime, the entire manual process to natively run Ansible-On-Windows is distilled over the following steps.

## REQUIREMENTS

__winAnsible__ uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [MSYS2] - independent rewrite of MSYS, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software.
* [git] - distributed revision control system aimed at speed,data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
* [pacman] - ported package management system from Archlinux
* [python and python-pip] - Python programming language, use pip to install and manage software packages written in Python.

#### Porting To Windows Environment Preparation

1. __winAnsible__ requires a preinstallation of [MSYS2](http://msys2.github.io/) to run.

2. Download and extract the [latest pre-built release](http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20161025.exe).

3. Start the MSYS2 terminal.

##### Installation Restrictions:
+ MSYS2 can't be installed on FAT* partitions.
+ Current MSYS2 can't be installed on Windows XP anymore.

### Difference between MSYS2 and MinGW
>MSYS2 refers to the libraries and programs that use the POSIX emulation layer ("msys2 runtime", derived from Cygwin's cygwin1.dll). It is very easy to port libraries and programs from Unix/Linux because most of the POSIX semantics is emulated reasonably well, for example the fork() function. Bash and Perl are examples of MSYS2 programs.


>MinGW refers to libraries and programs that are compiled using GNU tools but do not require any POSIX semantics, instead relying on the standard Win32 API and the C runtime library. MinGW stands for "Minimal GNU for Windows". Examples: cURL (a library to talk >to remote servers via HTTP(S), (S)FTP, etc), emacs, Inkscape, etc


>The POSIX emulation layer of MSYS2 binaries is convenient, but comes at a cost: Typically, MSYS2 programs are noticably slower than their MinGW counterparts (if there are such counterparts). As a consequence, the Git for Windows project tries to provide as many components as possible as MinGW binaries.

## Ansible On Windows Installation

```sh
$ pacman -Sy pacman
$ pacman -Syu base-devel libffi libffi-devel pkg-config gmp gmp-devel openssh openssl openssl-devel git python2 python2-setuptools
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/gluzangi/winansible.git $HOME/
$ cp $HOME/devops/ansible.localhost/roles/box/files/pyconfig.h /usr/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
$ pip install -U -r $HOME/devops/ansible.pip.requirements.txt
$ ansible --version
```
##### Known Ansible Limitation:
Mostly are SSH related features that have been observed to be missing (or need a workaround)
+  `ControlPath` to store the “control socket” for the multiplexed connections.
+  `ControlMaster` to activates multiplexing. SSH will try to use a master connection if one exists.
+  `ControlPersist` to keep the master connection alive for the specified period of time after it has remained idle (no connections). After that time, the master connection will be closed.

## For Production Environments
_A Windows Installer with automated script to prepare **ALL** required packages to complete a fully functional Ansible-On-Windows install_

## Todos

 - Complete Ansible install automation as a script ansible-on-win.sh
 - Reaserch on InstallForge and alternatives for Windows Software Packaging
 - [Git-On-Windows Installer Generator](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra)
 - Rethink Github Repos
 - Add Code Comments
